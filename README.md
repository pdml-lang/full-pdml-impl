# Full PDML Reference Implementation Written in Java

This repository contains the source code files of the PDML reference implementation written in Java.

All PDML extensions are implemented, but they are all experimental. Therefore this implementation is much more elaborate than a simple implementation supporting only Core PDML (without extensions).

For more information about PDML please visit its [website](https://pdml-lang.dev/).
