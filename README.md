# Full PDML Implementation Written in Java

This repository contains the source code files of a full PDML implementation written in Java.

This implementation supports PDML extensions, and is therefore much more elaborate than a simple implementation supporting only basic PDML (without extensions).

The parser included in this implementation supports the standard and alternative attribute syntaxes, as well as lenient parsing.
